This project allows you to easily add the [Mollie payment provider](https://www.mollie.com) to your application. Mollie has excellent [documentation](https://docs.mollie.com/) which I highly recommend you read before using this library.

For the full documentation of all library functions, please take a look at the [documentation on the Wiki](https://github.com/Viincenttt/MollieApi/wiki/). There is also a [.NET Blazor example project](https://github.com/Viincenttt/MollieApi/tree/development/samples/Mollie.WebApplication.Blazor) available that displays various features of the library. 

### Creating a payment in under a minute

Example code to create a iDeal payment for â‚¬100

using IPaymentClient paymentClient = new PaymentClient("{yourApiKey}", new HttpClient());
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest() {
    Amount = new Amount(Currency.EUR, 100.00m),
    Description = "Test payment of the example project",
    RedirectUrl = "http://google.com",
	Method = Mollie.Api.Models.Payment.PaymentMethod.Ideal
};
PaymentResponse paymentResponse = await paymentClient.CreatePaymentAsync(paymentRequest);
string checkoutUrl = paymentResponse.Links.Checkout.Href;
```
